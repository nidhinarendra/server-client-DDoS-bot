Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)
A network of infected computers are known as botnets (or simply bots).
This project contains a fully fledged, scalable DDoS attack architecture where botnets are capable of generating huge floods of traffic to overwhelm a target by TCP connection attacks.
The floods were created by sending more connection requests than the infrastructure devices such as load balancers, firewalls and application servers could handle. 
This is implemented using distributed cluster and socket programming. 
Disclaimer: This project is just a prototype to learn socket programming. No practical attacks have been done.
